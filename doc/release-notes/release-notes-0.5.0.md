Bitcoin version 0.5.0 is now available for download at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcore/files/Bitcoin/bitcore-0.5.0/

The major change for this release is a completely new graphical interface that uses the Qt user interface toolkit.

This release include German, Spanish, Spanish-Castilian, Norwegian and Dutch translations. More translations are welcome; join the project at Transifex if you can help:

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

For Ubuntu users, there is a new ppa maintained by Matt Corallo which you can add to your system so that it will automatically keep bitcore up-to-date.  Just type "sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bitcore/bitcore" in your terminal, then install the bitcore-qt package.

MAJOR BUG FIX  (CVE-2011-4447)

The wallet encryption feature introduced in Bitcoin version 0.4.0 did not sufficiently secure the private keys. An attacker who
managed to get a copy of your encrypted wallet.dat file might be able to recover some or all of the unencrypted keys and steal the
associated coins.

If you have a previously encrypted wallet.dat, the first time you run bitcore-qt or bitcored the wallet will be rewritten, Bitcoin will
shut down, and you will be prompted to restart it to run with the new, properly encrypted file.

If you had a previously encrypted wallet.dat that might have been copied or stolen (for example, you backed it up to a public
location) you should send all of your bitcores to yourself using a new bitcore address and stop using any previously generated addresses.

Wallets encrypted with this version of Bitcoin are written properly.

Technical note: the encrypted wallet's 'keypool' will be regenerated the first time you request a new bitcore address; to be certain that the
new private keys are properly backed up you should:

1. Run Bitcoin and let it rewrite the wallet.dat file

2. Run it again, then ask it for a new bitcore address.
Bitcoin-Qt: Address Book, then New Address...
bitcored: run the 'walletpassphrase' RPC command to unlock the wallet,  then run the 'getnewaddress' RPC command.

3. If your encrypted wallet.dat may have been copied or stolen, send  all of your bitcores to the new bitcore address.

4. Shut down Bitcoin, then backup the wallet.dat file.
IMPORTANT: be sure to request a new bitcore address before backing up, so that the 'keypool' is regenerated and backed up.

"Security in depth" is always a good idea, so choosing a secure location for the backup and/or encrypting the backup before uploading it is recommended. And as in previous releases, if your machine is infected by malware there are several ways an attacker might steal your bitcores.

Thanks to Alan Reiner (etotheipi) for finding and reporting this bug.
